				<h2>iPhone 4 (2010)</h2>
				<p>The iPhone 4 was the first phone that had such dense pixels that you could not distinguish them from each other. It was also the first iPhone with Apple's own SoC. It is the iPhone that has had the most interesting story, both that a prototype of it was left at a bar and sold to a tech news site, but also that it had an antenna that was so easy to short circuit that Apple sent a free cover to all customers.</p>
